                    A brief evaluation
                </h2>
                <p>Keyrings are a sign of amazing design. Despite being common and universal it showcases a cleverness in design and details. With the object being so widespread it has itself integrated in society is such a way that if not available the difference would be felt.
                </p>

                <p>Everybody has either, either for their house, workplace or even simply for a cabinet. A key ring has a simple and yet important function holding together all the keys and making sure that they are all available at the same time. The added function of being able to add different type of objects on it whilst still retaining their original function makes it ideal. The keyring itself doesn’t seem as an important object but it’s something that would be missed if not available.</p>
