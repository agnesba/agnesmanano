        <h1>LOVE YOURSELF CAMPAIGN</h1>
        <h2>Introducing “LOVE MYSELF”</h2>
        <p>BTS, one of the most representative boy bands in Korea, and its label Big Hit Entertainment are staging the LOVE MYSELF campaign, jointly with UNICEF.</p>
        <p>BTS and its label entered into a partnership officially with the Korean Committee for UNICEF affiliated with the United Nations on November 1, 2017, in an attempt to sponsor a campaign called #ENDviolence—UNICEF’s global campaign aimed at ensuring children and teens in the world lead safe and healthy lives without the fear of violence.</p>
        <p>BTS and its label entered into a partnership officially with the Korean Committee for UNICEF affiliated with the United Nations on November 1, 2017, in an attempt to sponsor a campaign called #ENDviolence—UNICEF’s global campaign aimed at ensuring children and teens in the world lead safe and healthy lives without the fear of violence.</p>
        <p class="Pressone">In this regard, BTS has created its own campaign called LOVE MYSELF, pursuing love and a better place to live for all. This is not a one-off event. For the next two years at least, BTS will continue to follow through with this campaign, along with #ENDviolence, and work to raise a BTS LOVE MYSELF fund.</p>
        <p>BTS and their fans around the world have so far made tireless efforts to shed light on a dark topic. The member artists of BTS have given back to society and have made donations to local communities. </p>
        <p>On behalf of them, their fans have done the same thing in every corner of the world. The fund raised through the first official campaign designed and participated in by BTS members will be used to protect and support child and teen victims of domestic and school violence as well as sexual assault around the world. Also, this will be used to provide an education to local communities for violence prevention.</p>
